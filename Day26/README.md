Instructions
You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. This new
list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.

e.g. `4 * 4 = 16`
4 squared equals 16.

DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

Example Output

[1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]

Hint

1. Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.

2. Make sure the squared_numbers is printed into the console for the code checking to work.
